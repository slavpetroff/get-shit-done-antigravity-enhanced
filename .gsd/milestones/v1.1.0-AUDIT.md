## Must-Haves Status

| Requirement                  | Verified   | Evidence     |
| ---------------------------- | ---------- | ------------ |
| `gsd_sync.py` implementation | ⬜ Pending | Phase 2 Goal |
| `gsd_select.py` logic        | ⬜ Pending | Phase 3 Goal |
| `/sync-skills` workflow      | ⬜ Pending | Phase 4 Goal |
| `/new-project` integration   | ⬜ Pending | Phase 4 Goal |

## Concerns

- **Performance**: Scanning global paths for MCP configs across multiple directories could be slow on legacy systems. Implementation should use efficient file walk patterns.
- **Cross-Platform Path Handling**: Differences between macOS/Linux and Windows path structures (e.g., `~/` vs `%APPDATA%`) must be handled robustly in Python.

## Recommendations

1. **Cache Layer**: Consider adding a simple `.gsd/.cache/discovery.json` to store found paths and only re-scan when requested by `/sync-skills` or after a significant period.
2. **Schema Validation**: Ensure the `registry.xml` schema is flexible enough to accommodate different MCP configuration structures from various IDEs.

## Technical Debt to Address

- [ ] Implement robust error handling for restricted directory access during global scanning.
